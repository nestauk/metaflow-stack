breadcrumbs
-----------

A way of communicating the output of metaflow tasks
with the rest of the world. Metaflow will drop it's output
in an S3 path, but when Metaflow is run in Docker, the
memory of it's S3 path is lost. To remedy this, we
monkey patch the Flow "start" step with a decorator
so that it prints out the S3 path via a tell-tale breadcrumb.
The breadcrumb can then be picked up from the Docker logs
via a regex. Hacky, but effective!
